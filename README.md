	<li>in stream side if your canvas size does not fill the screen refresh the page </li>
	<li>don't use chrome only latest version of firefox is recommended</li>
	<li>allow autoplay in firefox permissions</li>
	<li>via a good quality 1 hour and 30 minutes of stream takes 90 mB and all of that teacher is crying and drawing witout stoping which is an impossible</li>
	<li>use https and click on I understand the risks</li>
	<li>The highest received size of sounds blobs in every 7 seconds is 46kB(when the teacher all of 7 seconds is crying which is impossible as usuall) and the objects received from the board is 37 kB (when the teacher all of 5 seconds drawing without stop which is impossible as usuall) #almost 83kB is the highest and an impossible result</li>
