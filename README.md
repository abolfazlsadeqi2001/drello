## how to use with different devices
<ul>
	<li>mobile (question solving)</li>
	<li>tablet with smart phone (question solving and teaching)</li>
	<li>smart board(capture the board) + mobile(record the sound) (teaching)</li>
</ul>

## things to know before use
<ul>
	<li>if in streamer side after a bit time automatically streamer thrown out it happen as the previous sound and json file does not moved into their directory and is kept into temp stream direcotry(this directory usually must include only folders with named as numbers otherwise the streamers cannot stream)</li>
	<li>many refreshes can make conflict on time</li>
	<li>in stream side if your canvas size does not fill the screen refresh the page </li>
	<li>don't use chrome only latest version of firefox is recommended</li>
	<li>allow autoplay in firefox permissions</li>
	<li>via a good quality 1 hour and 30 minutes of stream takes 90 mB and all of that teacher is crying and drawing witout stoping which is an impossible</li>
	<li>use https and click on I understand the risks</li>
	<li>The highest received size of sounds blobs in every 7 seconds is 46kB(when the teacher all of 7 seconds is crying which is impossible as usuall) and the objects received from the board is 37 kB (when the teacher all of 5 seconds drawing without stop which is impossible as usuall) #almost 83kB is the highest and an impossible result</li>
	<li>read from recorded source is recommended rather than stream</li>
</ul>
